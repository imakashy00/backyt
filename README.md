# Vector Databases: Quick Notes

## Overview
- Emerging as a new database type for the AI era.
- Useful for enhancing large language models (e.g., GPT-4) with long-term memory.
- May not be necessary for all projects; traditional methods can suffice.

## Definition
- Vector Databases index and store vector embeddings for quick retrieval and similarity searches.
- Effectively manage unstructured data (e.g., social media, images, audio).

## Key Components
1. **Vector Embeddings**:
   - Created by ML models; numerical representations of data.
   - Enable similarity searches using distance metrics.

2. **Indexing**:
   - Optimizes query performance by transforming vectors for efficient searching.

## Use Cases
1. Long-term memory for language models (e.g., with LangChain).
2. Semantic search based on meaning.
3. Similarity search for media (images, audio, video).
4. Recommendation systems based on nearest neighbor identification.
